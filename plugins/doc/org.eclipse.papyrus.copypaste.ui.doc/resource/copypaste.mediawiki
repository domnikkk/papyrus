=Copying/Cutting/Pasting in Papyrus=
==Introduction==

Papyrus's policy is to ensure consistency between models and diagrams, so by default the cut/copy/paste functionalities act both on diagram and model elements.
The Copy/Cut/Paste functionalities are available between models and diagrams but not between eclipse instances.  
The Cut/Paste functionalities are disable on root and read only elements.

==User Interface== 
===Model Explorer Menu===
Right click on a model explorer element

 M1 is the COMMAND key on MacOS X, and the CTRL key on most other platforms.

== List of Paste strategies ==

=== Common Strategies ===

==== Default Paste Strategy  ====
The strategy paste all copied elements in the selected place.
It is required for all other strategies.

==== SterotypeStrategy ====
The strategy reapply profiles and stereotypes on the newly copied elements.

===== Preferences =====
* Always apply missing profiles: missing profiles will be applied to the root of the target model
* Never apply missing profiles: stereotypes referencing missing profiles will not be paste
<!-- * Featured :  Ask user : a popup will list all the missing profiles and ask the user which one to import -->

==== Rename Strategy ====

* Only the duplications of the '''roots elements''' will be renamed
* An element is renamed only if there is already an element with the '''same name''' on the paste selection
* The element will be renamed in CopyOf_%NameOfTheElement%_%id%. The id will be incremented for each ''same'' copy/paste. Example: a Class1 will become CopyOf_Class1_1 then CopyOf_Class1_2…
<!-- Featured : It will have two preferences, one for the prefix “copy_of” and one checkbox to disable the increment. -->
