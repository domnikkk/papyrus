    <h1 id="Introduction">Introduction</h1>
    <p>The standard UML specification provides a few hints to represent
      graphical elements. However, it only focuses on the general representation
      of these elements (e.g. A Class is a rectangle, with optional compartments
      for its attributes and operations, and its name should be displayed in
      italic if the Class is abstract). </p>
    <p>Nevertheless, for a better readability (and even esthetic), the user has
      a certain freedom for changing some graphical properties, such as an
      Element's color. Until now, in Papyrus, this customization could be done
      by two complement means: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Appearance tab (Properties view): change the appearance of the
        selected element(s) </li>
      <li>Preferences page: change the initial appearance of all newly created
        element(s)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>While this allows defining a custom theme for our diagrams, this
      mechanism suffers from a few limitations: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>It is not possible to create different categories of appearance for
        the same semantic Element (e.g. "Blue Class" and "Green class"). We'd
        have to create "Blue classes" and change some of them to
        "Green"manually. </li>
      <li>If we wanted to change the current theme, we'd have either to change
        each object's appearance one by one, or to write an automatic
        transformation, which could be really complicated. </li>
      <li>It is not easy to export a Theme, as they are stored in the Eclipse
        preferences. It is almost impossible to ship a ready-to-use distribution
        of Papyrus with a custom theme.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The Cascading StyleSheets (CSS) component adds the capacity to define
      some Stylesheets for your diagrams. Just like in web pages, the CSS format
      is used to separate the contents of our diagrams from their appearance. It
      becomes possible to change the appearance of a whole diagram, or even a
      set of diagrams, independently of the number of represented elements, in a
      single click.</p>
    <h1 id="Installation">Installation</h1>
    <p>The CSS Stylesheet support is now shipped in the base installation of
      Papyrus. It doesn't require any specific installation step anymore.</p>
    <p>Without the CSS component, or with the "Black &amp; White" CSS Theme,
      your diagrams look like: </p>
    <p><img border="0" src="Papyrus_CSS_no_theme.png" alt="Papyrus diagram without CSS Theme"

        title="Papyrus diagram without CSS Theme" /><br />
    </p>
    <p>With the default "Papyrus" CSS Theme, your diagrams look like:</p>
    <p><img border="0" src="Papyrus_CSS_theme.png" alt="Papyrus Diagram with CSS Theme"

        title="Papyrus Diagram with CSS Theme" /><br />
    </p>
    <p>Note: If you opened a diagram which has been created without the CSS
      Support, it may still have a user-defined appearance, e.g. without Element
      icons. This might or might not be a problem, as this may conflict with the
      CSS Theme. You can reset all custom appearances by pressing the "Default
      style" button in the Style tab of the Diagram's properties view.</p>
    <h1 id="Using_StyleSheets">Using StyleSheets</h1>
    <p>To define a custom style, the first step is to create a Stylesheet. The
      creation is really straightforward: a Stylesheet is a text file with the
      .css extension. You can create such a file using the "New &gt; File"
      wizard.<br />
      There are several options for using stylesheets.</p>
    <h2 id="Diagram_Stylesheets">Diagram Stylesheets</h2>
    <p>You can define a particular style for a diagram.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Select a diagram</li>
      <li>Go to the Style tab of the properties view</li>
      <li>Add a new "Diagram style sheet". There isn't currently any style sheet
        available from the diagram, so you need to create a new "Stylesheet
        reference".<br />
        <img border="0" src="Papyrus_CSS_Import_stylesheet.png" alt="Import stylesheet in Papyrus"

          title="Import stylesheet in Papyrus" /> </li>
      <li>Browse your workspace to find your css file, and press OK. Your
        stylesheet is now associated to your diagram.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2 id="Model_StyleSheet">Model StyleSheet</h2>
    <p>Similarily to "Diagram Stylesheet" you can define a particular style for
      a Model.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Select a model</li>
      <li>Go to the Style tab of the properties view</li>
      <li>Add a new "Model style sheet"</li>
      <li>Browse your workspace to find your css file, and press OK. Your
        stylesheet is now associated to your Model.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2 id="Project_Stylesheets">Project Stylesheets</h2>
    <p>You can associate to a project specific stylesheets.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Select a project in "Project Explorer" view</li>
      <li>Open project preference properties: "Right click &gt; properties"</li>
      <li>Go to CSS stylesheets page: "Papyrus &gt; Style sheets"</li>
      <li>Add a new "Project style sheet". There isn't currently any style sheet
        available from project, so you need to create a new "Stylesheet
        reference".<br />
        <img border="0" src="Papyrus_CSS_project.png" alt="Style sheets project properties in Papyrus"

          title="Style sheets project properties in Papyrus" /></li>
      <li>Browse your workspace to find your css file, and press OK. Now, your
        stylesheet is associated with the project.</li>
    </ol>
    <h1 id="Deploying_a_CSS_Theme">Deploying a CSS Theme</h1>
    <p>Once you have defined your style sheets, you may want to export it to
      create a new theme (Or to extend an existing theme). To do so, Papyrus
      provides two ways to define a theme.</p>
    <h2 id="With_extension_point">With extension point</h2>
    <p>Papyrus provides an extension point:
      org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.gmfdiag.css.theme. </p>
    <p>This extension point needs two entries: a Theme Definition (ID, Label and
      icon of the Theme), and Theme contributions (A set of style sheets which
      will compose the Theme). More than one plug-in can contribute to the same
      Theme, which makes it possible to extend a Theme. </p>
    <p>The Theme can be modified from the Papyrus preferences page "CSS Theme".
      Only one theme can be activated at the same time. A Theme applies to all
      Papyrus Diagrams from the workspace.<br />
    </p>
    <h2 id="In_workspace_preference">In workspace preference</h2>
    <p>You can define theme in workspace preferences. A theme is defined by
      style sheets.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Go to the Papyrus preference: "Window &gt; Preferences &gt; Papyrus
        &gt; CSS Theme"</li>
      <li>Add a new theme. There are currently two existing themes: "Papyrus
        Theme" and "Black &amp; White".<br />
        <img border="0" src="Papyrus_CSS_theme_creation.png" alt="Creation of theme in Papyrus"

          title="Creation of theme in Papyrus" /></li>
      <li>Write a name for this new theme</li>
      <li>(optional) Choose an icon</li>
      <li>Associate one or more style sheets with this theme</li>
      <li>Press OK to finish creation</li>
    </ol>
    <p>You can edit or create a theme with a selection of CSS files in Project
      Explorer view. For this, select the CSS files, right click and select "CSS
      Theme"</p>
    <h1 id="Editing_a_StyleSheet">Editing a StyleSheet</h1>
    <p>Papyrus Stylesheets are stored in text files with the ".css" extension
      (e.g. stylesheet.css).<br />
    </p>
    <h2 id="Manually:_The_CSS_Syntax">Manually: The CSS Syntax</h2>
    <h3 id="Syntax_elements">Syntax elements</h3>
    <p>The CSS syntax is a list of rules, which associates selectors and
      properties.<br />
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The selector: describes the condition which has to be fulfilled for a
        rule to be applied<br />
      </li>
      <li>The properties: describes the appearance of the elements matching the
        rule</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Eclipse implements the 2.1 version of the CSS syntax. The available
      selectors are:<br />
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>*</b>: Matches all elements<br />
      </li>
      <li><b>ElementType</b>: Matches the elements of type "ElementType"<br />
      </li>
      <li><b>.myStyle</b>: Matches the elements on which the style "myStyle" is
        applied<br />
      </li>
      <li><b>#myID</b>: Matches the element with the CSS ID "myID". The CSS ID
        must be unique among a diagram. To avoid confusing the users, and
        because this selector doesn't make much sense on diagrams, this selector
        has been disabled in Papyrus.<br />
      </li>
      <li><b>[property=value]</b>: Matches the elements which have a property
        "property" with the value "value". It can also match the properties of
        Stereotypes</li>
      <li><b>[appliedStereotypes~="MyStereotype"]</b>: Matches the elements on
        which the Stereotype "MyStereotype" is applied. You can use either the
        Stereotype's name or qualified name
        (MyProfile::MyPackage::MyStereotype). Note: always use the "~=" operator
        (Which means "contains"), because UML elements can have more than one
        applied stereotype.</li>
      <li><b>:pseudo</b>: Matches the element on which the pseudo-selector
        "pseudo" is applied. Pseudo-selectors are typically used for dynamic
        events, and for filtering some non-semantic properties. In Papyrus, they
        are used for identifying more precisely the floating labels (When an
        element has more than one label: see the <a href="#Mask_Label">Mask
          Label</a> chapter below), and they are also used by the animation
        framework to specify events (See the Moka documentation)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These selectors can be combined using one of the following combinators:<br />
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Selector1 Selector2</b>: Descendant selector. Matches the elements
        which match Selector2 and are contained in an element matching Selector1<br />
      </li>
      <li><b>Selector1 &gt; Selector2</b>: Child selector. Matches the elements
        which match Selector2 and are directly contained in an element matching
        Selector2<br />
      </li>
      <li><b>Selector1 + Selector2</b>: Sibling selector. Matches the elements
        which match Selector2 and are immediately preceded by a Sibling element
        which match Selector1.<br />
      </li>
      <li><b>Selector1, Selector2</b>: Alternative selector. Matches elements
        matching either Selector1 or Selector2</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A rule also contains a list of properties, in the form property:value; </p>
    <p>In Papyrus, the selectors apply to semantic elements and properties (i.e.
      UML Elements), and the properties apply to the appearance properties (i.e.
      GMF Appearance properties). A few custom properties (Independent from the
      GMF Appearance model) are also available (See "Supported properties"
      below).<br />
    </p>
    <h3 id="Examples">Examples</h3>
    <pre class="source-css">* {
    fillColor: red;
    fontColor: #0000FF;
}
</pre>
    <p> </p>
    <p>Meaning: all elements should be filled in red, and all texts should be
      blue (RGB Color #0000FF)<br />
    </p>
    <pre class="source-css">Class {
    gradient: white vertical;
    elementIcon:true;
    shadow:true;
    qualifiedNameDepth:full;
}
</pre>
    <p> </p>
    <p>Meaning: this style applies to all UML Classes. They will have a white
      and vertical gradient. The Element icon and the shadow will be displayed,
      as well as their fully qualified name.<br />
    </p>
    <pre class="source-css">ClassDiagram Class&gt;Property {
    fontColor: red;
}
</pre>
    <p> </p>
    <p>Meaning: The properties directly contained in a Class, which is drawn on
      a ClassDiagram (Either as a root element of the diagram, or in a Package)
      will be displayed in red.<br />
    </p>
    <pre class="source-css">[appliedStereotypes~="Block"]{
    bold:true;
}

/* Equivalent: qualified name */
[appliedStereotypes~="SysML::Blocks::Block"]{
    bold:true;

</pre>
    <p>Meaning: The elements with the "Block" stereotype must be displayed in
      bold.</p>
    <pre class="source-css">[appliedStereotypes~=Block][isEncapsulated=true]{
    fontColor:red;
}
</pre>
    <p>Meaning: The elements with the "Block" stereotype, and the stereotype
      property "isEncapsulated" set to true, must be displayed in red.</p>
    <p>All these rules can be combined:</p>
    <pre class="source-css">Class[appliedStereotypes~=Block][appliedStereotypes~=MyCustomStereotype][isEncapsulated=true][myCustomProperty=SomeValue][isAbstract=false]{
	/* A class on which the stereotypes "Block" and "MyCustomStereotype" are applied, 
	*  and on which the stereotype property "isEncapsulated" is set to true, 
	*  the stereotype property "myCustomProperty" is set to "SomeValue", and 
	*  the UML Property "isAbstract" is set to false */
	
	fillColor:red;
}
</pre>
    <h2 id="With_the_Papyrus_tooling">With the Papyrus tooling</h2>
    <p>Papyrus also provides a tool to generate a CSS Rule from an element
      displayed in the diagram. You need to create a stylesheet before you can
      edit it with the Create style tool, and it is recommended (Although not
      required) to associate this style sheet with your current diagram. </p>
    <p>To use it, create an element and change its appearance via the
      "Appearance" tab of the properties view. Then, right click on the element,
      and select "Format", "Create a new style". The dialog box contains three
      tabs:<br />
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Conditions: The conditions under which the style will be applied
        (Corresponds to the "CSS Selectors") </li>
      <li>Properties: The graphical properties to export to the style sheet </li>
      <li>Stylesheet: The style sheet to edit</li>
    </ul>
    <p><img border="0" src="Papyrus_CSS_Export_style.png" alt="Create style dialog"

        title="Create style dialog" /><br />
    </p>
    <p>In the Stylesheet tab, select your stylesheet:<br />
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>If you have already associated the style sheet to your diagram, you
        can use the "Applies stylesheet" button. </li>
      <li>Otherwise, you need to select "External stylesheet", and browse your
        workspace to retrieve the file. Note that in this case, as the edited
        stylesheet might not be applied to your diagram, you won't be able to
        see the changes in the current diagram.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In the conditions tab, there are three groups of options:<br />
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The kind of element to which the style applies (e.g. the style will be
        applied to "Class" elements, or to any kind of elements). It can be
        restricted to a specific diagram. </li>
      <li>You can add restrictions on the current value(s) of the element (e.g.
        the style will be applied to concrete classes). Only primitive type and
        enumerated attributes are supported here. </li>
      <li>The style name is used to apply a style manually.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The properties tab contains all the graphical properties that can be
      applied to the selected object. It is used to choose the graphical
      properties to apply on the objects matching the conditions.</p>
    <h1 id="Supported_properties">Supported properties</h1>
    <h2 id="Selector_properties">Selector properties</h2>
    <p>Selector properties are semantic element properties. They can be used
      with one of the following syntaxes:</p>
    <p><b>[isAbstract=true]</b></p>
    <p><b>Class[isAbstract=true]</b></p>
    <p>The supported semantic element properties are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Strings: <b>[name=MyName]</b>, <b>[name="My name"]</b> (Quotes are
        required for complex Strings)</li>
      <li>Integers: <b>[size="12"]</b> (Quotes are required) </li>
      <li>Booleans: <b>[isAbstract=true]</b> (Quotes are optional)</li>
      <li>Enumerations: <b>[visibility=visible]</b> (Quotes are optional)</li>
      <li>References to named elements (UML NamedElement or Ecore
        ENamedElement): <b>[type=String]</b></li>
    </ul>
    <p>The supported properties are the semantic properties of the UML element
      (e.g. isAbstract, name, type, ...), as well as the semantic properties of
      the stereotypes applied to the UML element (e.g. isEncapsulated for a
      SysML Block)</p>
    <p>Some selectors can also be used to represent some specific parts of an
      element. For example, it is possible to hide a specific compartment:</p>
    <pre class="source-css">Class &gt; Compartment[kind="attribute"] {
    visible:false;
}

Class &gt; Compartment[kind="symbol"] {
    visible:true;
}

Compartment[kind="structure"]{
    collapsed:true;
}

Port &gt; Label {
    visible: false;
}
</pre>
    <h2 id="Style_properties">Style properties</h2>
    <p>Style properties are graphical properties supported by the display. Note
      that some graphical elements may not support some specific properties
      (Either because they shouldn't support them, or because they are not yet
      implemented). For example, a UML::Class will not support the <i>italic</i>
      property, because in UML, <i>italic</i> means <i>abstract</i>.</p>
    <p>The CSS Supports all GMF Notation properties, as well as a few
      Papyrus-specific properties. This chapter will only list all the
      Papyrus-specific properties.</p>
    <p>The simplest way to discover new style properties is to use the
      Appearance tab of the Properties view in Papyrus. When hovering one of the
      appearance properties, the tooltip indicates the name of the corresponding
      CSS property</p>
    <p><img border="0" src="Papyrus_CSS_tooltip.png" alt="CSS Property in tooltip"

    <h3 id="Value_types">Value types</h3>
    <p><b>String:</b> Simple (Ascii) strings can be written without quotes: <i>property:value</i>.
      Complex strings must be written with quotes: <i>property: "my value"</i>;
      <i>path: "platform:/plugin/my.example.plugin/resources/myFile.ext";</i><br />
      <b>Integer:</b> Quotes are optional: <i>size: 18</i><br />
      <b>Boolean:</b> Quotes are optional: <i>bold: true</i><br />
      <b>Color:</b> There are three ways for using colors. The simplest one is
      to use the list of predefined <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-color/#svg-color">CSS
        Color names</a>: <i>fillColor: teal</i>. It is also possible to use the
      Hexadecimal RGB notation: <i>fillColor: #008080</i>. The last option is
      to use the rgb() function: <i>fillColor: rgb(0, 128, 128)</i></p>
    <h3 id="Mask_Label">Mask Label</h3>
    <p>Some labels can be configured with a "Mask": in the appearance tab of the
      properties view, some elements have a list of checkboxes which are used to
      select which parts of the label should be displayed (e.g. visibility,
      type, name, multiplicity...)</p>
    <p>The CSS property "maskLabel" has the same purpose. The value of this
      property is the list of labels to display. For example, if you want to
      display only the name of the Ports, write:</p>
    <pre class="source-css">Port &gt; Label {
	maskLabel: name;
}
</pre>
    <p>If you want to display the name, type and multiplicity of a Property,
      write:</p>
    <pre class="source-css">Property {
	maskLabel: name type multiplicity;
}
</pre>
    <p>Note that the order of the values doesn't matter. It is also important to
      understand the difference between the port and the property: the rule to
      match the port's label is different than the one for the property, because
      the Port is represented with two graphical elements: a square for the
      Port, and a floating text for its label. The Property is represented with
      a single text element. It is especially important for Associations, as
      Association have six different labels: one label for the Association
      itself, two labels for each association end (Source and target), and one
      label for the Association's stereotypes. The rules for configuring
      associations thus needs to be more precise. For example:</p>
    <pre class="source-css">Association &gt; Label:sourceMultiplicity {
	visible:false;
}

Association &gt; Label:targetMultiplicity {
	visible:false;
}

Association &gt; Label:sourceRole {
	maskLabel: name multiplicity;
}

Association &gt; Label:targetRole {
	maskLabel: name multiplicity;
}

Association &gt; Label:name {
	visible:false;
}
</pre>
    <p>These rules result in:</p>
    <p><img border="0" src="Papyrus_CSS_maskLabel_association.png" alt="Association labels result"

        title="Association labels result" /><br />
    </p>
    <p>The list of accepted values depends on the element. To find the list of
      values, select an element in a Diagram (e.g. a Property), go to the
      Appearance tab of the properties view, and find the list of checkboxes
      named "Label customization". Hover the checkboxes, and look at the tooltip
      to find the value:</p>
    <p><img border="0" src="Papyrus_CSS_maskLabel.png" alt="Mask label" title="Mask label" /><br />
    </p>
    <p>To obtain the result shown in this screenshot, write:</p>
    <pre class="source-css">Property {
	maskLabel: name type defaultValue;
}
</pre>
    <p>Which results in:</p>
    <p><img border="0" src="Papyrus_CSS_maskLabel_result.png" alt="Mask label result"

        title="Mask label result" /><br />
    </p>
    <h1 id="Manipulating_styles">Manipulating styles</h1>
    <p>The computed styles will be applied automatically. For example, if your
      stylesheet tells that all your abstract classes must be red, the classes
      color will change automatically according to the value of their
      "isAbstract" property. </p>
    <p>In some other cases, however, you may want to specify manually the style
      that should be applied to your objects. For this case, you can use the
      "Applied styles" property in the "Style" tab of the properties view.<br />
    </p>
    <pre class="source-css">.myOwnStyle {
    fillColor: #A6C198;
    gradient:white horizontal;
}
</pre>
    <p> </p>
    <p><img border="0" src="Papyrus_CSS_CustomStyle.png" alt="Result" title="Result" /><br />
    </p>
    <p>Once a style is applied on an object, the object will be refreshed each
      time the style definition changes. For example, changing the style
      "myOwnStyle" to the following declaration:<br />
    </p>
    <pre class="source-css">.myOwnStyle {
     fillColor: #E3A49C;
     gradient: #FFFFFF horizontal;
}
</pre>
    <p> </p>
    <p>All the green classes will become red.</p>
    <h1 id="Limitations_and_issues">Limitations and issues</h1>
    <p>There are currently a few identified limitations to the Stylesheet
      framework, as well as a few minor bugs:<br />
    </p>
    <h2 id="Selectors">Selectors</h2>
    <p>Currently, some complex selectors are not supported in the Papyrus
      stylesheets. Especially, the following are not supported yet:<br />
    </p>
    <h3 id="Selector_inheritance">Selector inheritance</h3>
    <p>It is not possible to apply a style to all descendant of a given
      Metaclass. For example, a Behavior will not inherit styles from a Class,
      although a Behavior actually is a Class.<br />
    </p>
    <h3 id="Events_support">Events support</h3>
    <p>Selectors based on user events are not yet implemented. For example, the
      CSS specification defines the :hover pseudo-selector to represent an
      element hovered by the mouse, which is not yet supported in Papyrus.<br />
