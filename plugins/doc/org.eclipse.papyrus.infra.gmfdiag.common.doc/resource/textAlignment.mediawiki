==Apply text alignment with CSS==
Text alignment can be defined through the CSS attributes "textAlignment" :

Example for Label of Port aligned to the right:

<source lang="css">Port > Label {
   textAlignment:"right";
   }</source>
   
   
Note: Text alignment of port's label is forced according to the position of its parent when it is constrained.
