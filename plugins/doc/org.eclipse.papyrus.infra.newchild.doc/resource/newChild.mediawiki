=Requirements=
; AddNewChild (id=newChild001): : Papyrus shall add in the menu new child for new customized elements by using extended type
; HideElement (id=newChild002): : Papyrus shall not display all UML or SysML element creation
; newChildFromProfile (id=newChild003): : Papyrus shall add the creation of new element from a subset of profile
; newChildMenuDisplay (id=newChild004): : Papyrus shall be able to associate icons to folder or creation menu
; RoleAndElementCreation (id=newChild005): : When an element can be created from several roles for a container, Papyrus shall let the possibility to choose the role or to let to the possibility to be created from all roles.
=Use Cases=
[[Image:UseCaseDiagram.png|UseCaseDiagram]]<br>
==UseCreateMenu==
The Papyrus User shall use this functionality from the model explorer in order to create elements in the model. He can decide to display or not this element creation.
===How to===
In order to not display a menu,  a user can edit the model that represents the creation menu and set the attribute visibility to false.

==Create or modify ElementCreationModel==
An advanced User is able to create or modify creation menu. This menu is a model that can be edited 
===How to===
An advanced user can contribute to the menu by adding a new plugin that contains:
*a xmi file that represents a creation menu. The model must be an instance of org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.newchild/resource/elementCreationMenuModel.ecore. It contains<br>
**CreationMenu<br>
***It corresponds to a menu<br>
***The ElemenTypeIDRef corresponds a reference to the element Type.<br>
***The role can be filled in order to specify the role play by the element.<br>
***If displayAllRole is set to true, it displays all roles played by the element if the number of roles is greater than 1. By default this property is true;<br>
**Folder<br>
***It is possible to add owns label an icon.<br>
**Visibility to specify if the folder is visible.<br>
*a reference to an extension point, to specify that papyrus must take in account this file to display the menu<br>

<source lang="xml">
<extension
         point="org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.newchild">
      <menuCreationModel
            model="YourCreationMenu.xmi">
      </menuCreationModel>
</extension>
</source>

In the following example, a menu creation for a package is presented. This menu is contained in the folder SimpleUMLTest. We have associated an image for this menu.
<br>[[Image:PackageWithIconO.png|Creation menu for a package with a specific icon]]<br>
<br>[[Image:PackageWithIconOIllustration.png|Result for this menu]]<br>

In this following example, a creation menu will be specified to allow creation of nested classifier. That 's why the role "nestedClassifier" is precised. The label for this creation is "nestedClass"
<br>[[Image:NestedClassifierIllustration.png|Result for the menu nestedClass]]<br>
<br>[[Image:NestedClassifier.png|Creation menu model for nested class]]<br>

In the following example a creation menu is created for activities. In this case, all roles are displayed. Thanks to this, when we want to associate an activity to a state, 3 roles are proposed.

==Generate "ElementCreationModel" from a profile==
From a stereotyped profile, a model of new child menu can be generated.
For example a user after designing a profile, want to have a dedicated menu  from this profile/
For the moment this function is not implemented.
==Hide, change order or add submenus==
The User can modify the creation menu by adding submenus: order about new child menu, precise if the role must be displayed.
===How to===
It only needed to change the order of element in the corresponding creation menu model

==Create or modify ElementCreationModel at runtime thanks to a GUI==
A user can edit a the model that represents the creation menu  at runtime for papyrus thanks to a dedicated UI.
For the moment this function is not implemented.
